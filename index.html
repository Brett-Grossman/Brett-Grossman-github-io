                        My name is Brett Grossman and I was born and raised in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.
                        I graduated with a bachelor of arts degree for enviornmental sciences from Lake Forest College, 
                        but I always had a love for technology. Instead of pursuing a job related to my degree I instead attended an
                        online coding bootcamp from Colorado Technical Institute where I got my certification in full-stack web development.
                        Although I learned Python, Java, and Javascript I feel most comfortable using JS and MERN subcomponents.
                        In my free time I mostly on my computer playing games or playing with my 11 year-old silver lab named Cali.

                        This group project was a part of my final show of skill for the Bootcamp I was in. It hosts a ton of features
                        that took some to time to piece together that would resemble a real home listing website. 
                        Two of the biggest features are the filters box that allows specified search results of a data table and
                        the ability to have a personal account with its own suite of features as well.

                        This Javascript application was used as an anonymous forum that allowed anyone to make posts about 
                        their favorite spaceships from the game StarCitizen. it featured full CRUD capabilities and image link 
                        recognition.
